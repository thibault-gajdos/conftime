"The influence of evidence volatility on choice, reaction time and confidence in a perceptual decision." Elife 5 (2016): e17688.StimulusRandom-dot kinematogram. Fixed stimulus duration of 200 ms. Participants had to decide if the net direction of motion was rightward or leftward. In the .csv file, the field 'Stimulus' indicates the true direction of motion (0: leftward; 1: rightward). For trials of 0% motion coherence, the direction of motion that led to positive feedback was selected at random. Confidence scaleTwo crescent-shaped targets presented on each side of the fixation. The left (right) target was used to indicate that the perceived direction of motion was to the left (right, respectively). Subjects were instructed to select the upper extreme of the targets if they were completely certain of their decision (Confidence = 1), and the lowermost extreme if their confidence was not higher than guessing (Confidence = 0). Intermediate values represent intermediate levels of confidence. ManipulationsMotion strength and motion volatility were varied pseudo-randomly from trial to trial.In the .csv file, the field 'Coherence' denotes the strength of motion (six possible values) and the field 'Condition' denotes volatility (0: low volatility, 1: high volatility).Block size96 trials. Each subject performed 4-6 blocks per day, over many days (~4) until completing 1536-2107 trials per participant.FeedbackAfter each test, participants received auditory feedback that indicated whether the choice was correct or incorrect.NaN fieldsResponses were recorded as NaN if subjects failed to maintain fixation during the motion epoch.Subject populationYoung adults (graduate and under-graduate students of Columbia University, NY).Response deviceEyetracker and computer keyboard.Experiment goalTest the predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model for how evidence strength and volatility affect choice, reaction time and confidence. Main resultAn increase in noise leads to faster decisions and higher confidence despite negligible effects on accuracy, consistent with the model's prediction.Experiment datesData were collected between April, 2015 and May, 2015.Location of data collectionMike Shadlen lab at Columbia University, New York, USA.Language of data collectionEnglish.CategoryOther: Decision-making.--------------------------------------------Fields in the .csv file: 'Subj_idx'  : subject identification number (1 to 3)'Stimulus'  : 0: leftward motion; 1: rightward motion. Selected at random for trials of 0% motion coherence.'Response'  : 0: left-target chosen; 1: right-target chosen.'Confidence': continuous between 0 (confidence not higher than guessing) and 1 (full certainty).'RT_decConf': time between the offset of the motion stimulus and the moment at which the participant pressed the space-bar to input his or her decision.'Coherence' : probability that a dot is displaced in motion as opposed to randomly.'Condition' : 0: low volatility; 1: high volatility.'Accuracy'  : 0: incorrect motion judgment; 1: correct motion judgment.'Block'     : block number.'Date'      : day in which the data were collected (format: yyymmdd).
