Stimulus type:     		Random dot kinematogram, with coherent motion either leftwards or rightwards (1=left; 2=right).

Confidence scale:  		Post-decisional confidence ratings, using a discrete 9-point scale (1=guess; 9=certain)

Manipulations:	   		None

Block size: 	  		2 blocks x 160 trials for each subject

Feedback:			Not provided during the main task.

NaN fields:	   		Reflect failure to provide a valid response within the allocated time limit (1.5s for perceptual decisions and 3s for confidence ratings)

Subject population:		20-32 years old

Response device:    		MR-compatible button box

Experiment setting: 		MRI scanner

Training:	  		Yes (a total of ~40 mins of training per subject prior to the main experiment, serving to establish individual perceptual thresholds and familiarity with the task) 

Experimental goal: 		Identify spatiotemporal correlates of confidence during perceptual decision making.

Main result: 	  		Early neural correlates of confidence in the human ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

Instructions:			Subjects instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible and to make a choice on every trial. Additionally, subjects were encouraged to explore the entire confidence scale, and to abstain from making a confidence rating on trials where the perceptual task response was accidental/unintended. 

Experiment dates:		2015-2016

Location of data collection: 	University of Glasgow


Other important information

Subject exclusion:		"Excluded_subj" column marks data excluded from the analysis (1=excluded, 0=not excluded). Six subjects were excluded due to 1) suboptimally-calibrated stimulus difficulty leading to very high/poor behavioural performance (subjects #2, #16, #18, and #22), 2) insufficient use of the confidence scale range (subject #27), and poor (chance) EEG decoder performance (subject #26).
RT for confidence ratings:	"RT_conf" column represents the time elapsed between the onset of the confidence rating screen and subjects' commitment to the confidence rating selection.
				Two sources of random variability for these quantities should be considered: 1) the confidence rating cue is preceded by a (post-decisional) temporal jitter of 1.5-4 seconds; 2) to make a confidence selection, subjects moved a visual indicator along the rating scale, which was positioned randomly each trial (to control for motor preparation).
